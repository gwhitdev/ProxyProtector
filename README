This is an experiment at creating a HTTP proxy in NodeJS, writing some classes to check for credit card numbers via a regex and practice at writing a basic client and server.
Test client: https://github.com/gwhitdev/HttpTestClient
Test server: https://github.com/gwhitdev/HttpTestServer

The test client will run on port 9000, the proxy will run on port 5612 and the server will run on 10000.
When the client is running make a HTTP request to: http://localhost:9000/message?content={MESSAGE} where MESSAGE is your message. It may or may not include a Visa or Mastercard credit card number.

Sample card numbers:
Visa: 4111111111111111
Mastercard: 5105105105105100
